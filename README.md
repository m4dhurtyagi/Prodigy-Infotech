# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classical encryption technique used for securing text. The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. This code provides functions for both encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features
* Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text by a specified number of positions forward in the alphabet.
* Decryption: Reverses the encryption process by shifting each letter backward by the specified number of positions.
* Interactive Command-Line Interface: Prompts the user to input text and shift value, and then select whether to encrypt or decrypt the text.
