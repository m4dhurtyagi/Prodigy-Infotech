# Password Strength Analyzer in Python
This repository features a Python script designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on various criteria. The script checks for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric digits, special characters, and the minimum length requirement, providing a percentage-based score to indicate the overall strength of the password.

## Features

* Lowercase Letter Check: Ensures that the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
* Numeric Digit Check: Ensures that the password contains at least one numeric digit.
* Special Character Check: Ensures that the password contains at least one special character.
* Length Check: Ensures that the password meets a minimum length requirement of 8 characters.
* Strength Score: Calculates and displays the password strength as a percentage based on the criteria met.
